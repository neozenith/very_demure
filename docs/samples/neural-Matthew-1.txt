Welcome to this one-minute guided mindfulness meditation.

Take a moment to find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Relax your shoulders and close your eyes if that feels comfortable for you.

Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. <break time="3s" /> 

Now slowly exhale through your mouth, letting go of any tension. <break time="3s" />

Feel the air entering your nostrils, traveling down to your lungs, and nourishing your body. <break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" />

Notice the rise and fall of your chest with each breath you take. <break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" />

Allow your mind to settle, letting go of any worries or thoughts. <break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" />

Feel the calm and stillness growing inside you. <break time="10s" /><break time="10s" /><break time="10s" />

When you are ready, gently bring your attention back to the present moment. <break time="3s" />

Open your eyes, take another deep breath in, and carry this sense of peace with you throughout your day.

Thank you for meditating with me.
