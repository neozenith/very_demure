<speak><prosody rate="slow" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Welcome to this one-minute guided mindfulness meditation.

Find a comfortable position, either seated or lying down, and close your eyes.

Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs with air, and then slowly exhale, releasing any tension in your body.

Bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils, or the rise and fall of your chest and abdomen.

Let your breath flow naturally, without trying to change it in any way. Simply observe it, and allow your mind to become calm and focused.

Now, bring your attention to your body. Notice any sensations of warmth or coolness, any areas of tension or discomfort.

As you breathe, imagine that with each inhale, your body is filling up with a sense of peace and relaxation. And with each exhale, any tension or stress is leaving your body.

Take a few more breaths, continuing to focus on your breath and your body.

When you're ready, gently open your eyes and take a moment to notice any changes in your body or mind.</prosody></speak>
