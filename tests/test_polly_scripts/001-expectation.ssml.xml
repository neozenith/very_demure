<speak><prosody rate="x-slow" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Hello and welcome to this one-minute guided mindfulness meditation.

Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.

Notice the sensation of your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Feel the rise and fall of your chest and the expansion and contraction of your belly.

Now, bring your attention to your body. Notice any sensations or feelings that arise. Allow them to be there without judgment or reaction.

Take a moment to scan your body from head to toe. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort. Allow them to soften and release with each exhale.

Now, bring your attention to your thoughts. Notice any thoughts that arise without judgment or reaction. Let them pass by like clouds in the sky.
