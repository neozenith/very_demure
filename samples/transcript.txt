Welcome to this guided mindfulness meditation session. Find a comfortable position, sitting or lying down, allowing your body to settle into the surface beneath you. Gently close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so. 

Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment. Now, slowly exhale through your mouth, releasing any tension you may be holding. Let’s do this again. Inhale deeply... hold... and exhale slowly. As you breathe out, feel your body begin to relax.

Bring your awareness to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your inhalation and exhalation. There’s no need to change your breathing. Just observe it for a few moments. Feel the air as it enters your nose, travels down into your lungs, and gently flows back out. 

If your mind begins to wander, that’s perfectly okay. Just acknowledge those thoughts without judgment and gently guide your focus back to your breath. Inhale... and exhale.

Now, bring your attention to your body. Start at the top of your head. Notice any sensations there. Are there any areas of tension or relaxation? Let your awareness move down to your forehead, your eyes, your cheeks, and your jaw. Release any tension you may find.

Continue to scan down your neck and shoulders. With each breath out, allow any tightness to melt away. Let this relaxation flow down your arms, into your hands and fingers. Feel the warmth and weight of your arms as they rest.

Now, bring your attention to your chest. Feel your breath moving in and out, expanding and contracting. Let this feeling of relaxation spread through your ribcage and into your back. Allow any areas of discomfort to soften.

Continue your awareness down to your abdomen. With each breath, feel it rise and fall. Notice the gentle rhythm of your body. Let this calm energy flow into your hips, your legs, moving down to your knees, calves, and finally, your feet. Focus on how your whole body feels now—heavy, relaxed, at ease.

As you breathe in, visualize calm and positivity entering your body. As you breathe out, imagine any stress or tension leaving your body. With every breath in, you invite peace... and with every breath out, you let go of worry.

Now, take a moment to appreciate this stillness. Embrace the present moment, free from judgment and distraction. Allow yourself to simply be here—fully present. 

As we approach the end of this meditation, slowly bring your awareness back to your breath. Feel the air flowing in and out. When you are ready, begin to wiggle your fingers and toes, bringing some gentle movement back into your body.

In your own time, gently open your eyes. Take a moment to adjust, and notice how you feel now compared to when you began. Carry this sense of calm and mindfulness with you as you go through your day.

Thank you for joining this guided meditation. Remember, you can return to this practice whenever you need to reconnect with your breath and find peace in the present moment.
